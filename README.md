# Welcome
welcome to spotisaber a tool for efficently adding maps to beatsaber from spotify
spotisaber only retrives a map with a simmilar name to the song in spotify so said map may be of lower quality
on first start up please accept the promt to install spotipy and syncsaber api, there will be a lot of text, this is normal

### Whats a playlist link?
to find the spotify link go to a spotify playlist and rightclick > share > copylink to playlist 
then paste it into the terminal

### I keep getting errors
make sure you are running the program on python 3, if you do not have python installed please install it at python.com
sometimes there may be spesific hardware errors that are out of the programms control if you get on please add it to the issues tab


### Where are the tracks downloaded
if you choose to download the tracks it will download through your defalt browser and to the same place that browser downloads to
try not to request more than 500 maps at a time as it could overload the syncsaber api

### Will you make a propper gooye
I will not make a propper gui beacuse im stupied and i like text based programs like an old text adventure 

#### dont do anything bad like spamming the servers yadda yadda
