# Welcome
welcome to spotisaber a tool for efficently adding maps to beatsaber from spotify
spotisaber only retrives a map with a simmilar name to the song in spotify so said map may be of lower quality
on first start up please accept the promt to install spotipy and syncsaber api, there will be a lot of text, this is normal

# Faq
^ whats a playlist link?
to find the spotify link go to a spotify playlist and rightclick > share > copylink to playlist
then paste it into the terminal


if you get an error restart the program and try again

if you choose to download the tracks it will download through your defalt browser and to the same place that browser downloads to
try not to request more than 500 maps at a time as it could overload the syncsaber api

dont do anything bad like spamming the servers yadda yadda
